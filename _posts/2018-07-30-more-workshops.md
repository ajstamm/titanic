Borrowing from Andy, I would like to write more three hour cruises! Topics I am interested in include:

- Intermediate R Programming:
  - Functions, packages, etc.
- Machine Learning
- Advanced R Programming:
  - Projects, Git, Markdown, tidyverse
- Shiny, LaTeX

But there are only so many hours in a day. If you would like to help, let me (or Andy) know.

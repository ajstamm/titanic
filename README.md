# Titanic Introduction to R

This repository holds all of the R workshops that I have taught and am developing. The first two were developed by [Andy Choens](https://github.com/choens) and are used with permission. For more R workshops, visit his page.

Check out my [R workshops](https://ajstamm.github.io/titanic).

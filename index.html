    In the span of only a few years, R has become the lingua franca of statistics. 
    The Titanic Introduction To R <i>(TITR)</i> Workshops are a series of three 
    hour cruises designed to introduce new users to R.

    In order to make these workshops useful to a wide variety of participants, 
    pre-requisites are almost non-existent. Participants are not expected to 
    have prior programming experience, but they are expected to have a basic 
    understanding of the statistical concepts discussed during the workshop 
    they are taking.

    In the span of only a few years, R has become the lingua franca of
    statistics. The Titanic Introduction To R <i>(TITR)</i> Workshops are a series
    of three hour cruises designed to introduce new users to
    R.
</p>
<p>
    In order to make these workshops useful to a wide variety of
    participants, pre-requisites are almost non-existent. Participants
    are not expected to have prior programming experience, but they
    are expected to have a basic understanding of the statistical
    concepts discussed during the workshop they are taking.
